Sender:

The input is taken from 4x4 matric keypad. The keypad is connected to one of the port of SSTE516RD.As soon as any key press is detected the corresponding bit pattern is send to LED bit by bit serially according to the program condition. For example, if key ‘1 ’ is pressed, then the bit pattern 00000001 is sent serially. There is some delay given between individual bit to easily recognize that the entire byte is correctly sent or not. LED is connected to one of the port bit through which all this serial bit will be transmitted. Initially the LED is at logic high (1-LED ON). We have added a start bit (0) before individual character to be transferred, to make the start of conversation between sender and receiver easy.

Receiver:

The receiver side consist of LDR module and one SSTE51RD and 16x2 LCD to display the received character. LDR module gives digital output high (1) whenever light falls on it and gives digital output zero (0) when no light is detected. Initially the logic of the LED is high (1), means that there is no key pressed. So at the receiver side, LDR continuously gives logic high value(1). As soon as a logic low value is detected by LDR, that LED off (start bit) indicating the first character to be transferred, then LDR starts sensing light and according gives bit patter to the IC and accordingly the value of individual bit is transferred to the the port where the data lines of 16x2 LCD is connected. After transfer of character to the port at receiver side, character is determined through 8-bits and accordingly the character is displayed on LCD. In this way sending and receiving of individual character is done in Li-Transferencia.
